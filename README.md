backbone_crud-demo
==================

A backbone CRUD demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsEw2i4wQMM

Will add localStorage and backend support.


Demo is available at:

http://dixitruth.com/tmp/backbone_crud-demo/demo1.html

http://dixitruth.com/tmp/backbone_crud-demo/demo2.html


to install the jquery, underscore, and backbone, it seems this way is better:

(1) add bower.json to manage the dependency package

(2) bower install

(3) use bower_components/ instead of 'CDN'.
